# Tic-Tac-Toe-3-Modes-

This is a quick project I have coded up during winter break. There are four modes of tic-tac-toe. The first mode is a 2 human player mode. 
The type of mode where the player competes against the "computer". The easy player vs "computer" mode more or less has the program place
its markers (either X or O) on remaining spots on the board. In the medium difficulty mode, the program actively tries to block the player
from getting three in a row.However, in this mode, the program will not nessisarily make 3 in a row if two markers are put in a winning combination. 
Rather, aside from blocking, the program places the markers more or less randomly as in easy mode. The "hard" mode has the program actively try to make three in a row 
if a chance arises. While initial placements tend to be random, the program will quickly start attempting to make connections while the spaces fill up. 
The next theoretical stage would be an "impossible" mode where the best outcome for the player is to tie. This may be done using a min-max method. I may add this in the 
future. Currently, there is a bit of a bug where the program sometimes skips a turn. This will be fixed in the future. However, for now, it is an advantage to the player!
